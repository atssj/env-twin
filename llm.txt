# env-twin - Environment Variable Management Tool

## Package Overview
**env-twin** is a powerful TypeScript-based CLI tool that automatically synchronizes environment variable keys across multiple `.env*` files in Node.js projects. It ensures consistency between `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.example`, and other environment configuration files.

## Description
env-twin streamlines environment variable management by copying missing keys across all `.env*` files while preserving comments and formatting. This environment synchronization tool sanitizes sensitive values in example files by replacing them with descriptive placeholders (e.g., `input_db_password`), enhancing security without compromising usability.

With built-in backup creation, restoration, and cleanup capabilities, env-twin provides rollback functionality to safeguard your environment configurations. This cross-platform solution works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## Key Features

### Environment Variable Synchronization
- Automatically syncs all environment variable keys across `.env*` files
- Maintains existing values while adding missing keys
- Preserves comments, formatting, and file structure

### Security & Privacy
- Creates sanitized `.env.example` templates with placeholder values
- Protects sensitive data by removing actual credentials from example files
- Ensures secure sharing of environment templates

### Backup & Recovery
- Automatically generates timestamped backups before modifying files
- Provides robust restore functionality with rollback capabilities
- Includes cleanup commands to manage old backups efficiently

### Developer Experience
- Lightweight CLI with zero external dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Flexible configuration options

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Synchronize environment variable keys with automatic backup
env-twin sync

# Restore files from backups with optional timestamp
env-twin restore [timestamp]

# Clean old backups while keeping specified number
env-twin clean-backups --keep <number>
```

### Common Workflows
1. Run `env-twin sync` to synchronize all environment files
2. Share `.env.example` files safely without exposing credentials
3. Restore previous configurations using timestamped backups
4. Clean up old backups to optimize storage space
